"""
Tree-branching conversations for gptme with branch evaluation/prediction.

The idea is to evaluate if we are on the right track by checking if the current branch is "good"/making progress, and otherwise backtracking to the last good branch and trying a different prompt/approach.

The goal is to have a more autonomous agent which can self-supervise and make several branching attempts to find the right path to the solution.

TODO:
- [ ] add a "feedback" action which lets the critic give feedback as a user to the agent
- [ ] fix so that we undo to a meaningful point
- [ ] ask the agent wether changes are good before applying (tricky)
