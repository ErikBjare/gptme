User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```

    if n < 2:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script successfully found that the 100th prime number is 541. 

We can verify this is correct by:
1. Confirming 541 is prime (it is - its only factors are 1 and itself)
2. Checking that there are exactly 99 prime numbers before it (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., 523, 541)

The script uses an efficient approach by:
- Using trial division up to the square root of the number to test primality
- Incrementally checking numbers until we find the nth prime

Would you like me to modify the script in any way or would you like to verify the result?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
