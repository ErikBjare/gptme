Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: ```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The patch was successfully applied to hello.py. The file now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". 

Let's verify this by reading the contents of hello.py:

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                
print("Hello, human!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The contents of hello.py have been successfully updated to print "Hello, human!". 

Now, let's run the script to see the output:

```shell
python3 hello.py
```                                                                                
Preview
python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, human!

System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, human!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script hello.py has been successfully run and prints "Hello, human!" as expected.
