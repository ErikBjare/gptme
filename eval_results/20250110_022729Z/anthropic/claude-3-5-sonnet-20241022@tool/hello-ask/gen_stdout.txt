I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name. The file is simple, so I can easily identify the line to change and replace it with input and formatted output.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
