User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+name = input("What is your name? ")                                            
+print(f"Hello, {name}!")                                                       

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! I used the `patch` tool to modify the `hello.py` file. The changes I made are:
1. Added an `input()` function to prompt the user for their name
2. Used an f-string to create a personalized greeting that includes the user's name

Now when the script is run, it will:
- Ask "What is your name? "
- Wait for the user to type their name
- Print a personalized greeting like "Hello, Alice!"

Would you like me to show you the contents of the file to confirm the changes?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
