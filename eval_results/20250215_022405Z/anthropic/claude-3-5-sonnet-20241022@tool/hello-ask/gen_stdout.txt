1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file
2. The patch tool is perfect for this small change
3. I can see the current content is a simple print statement
4. I'll replace it with input() for the name and an f-string print
</thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
