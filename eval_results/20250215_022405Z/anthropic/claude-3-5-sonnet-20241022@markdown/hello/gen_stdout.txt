I'll use the save tool to create a simple hello.py script that prints "Hello, world!".
</thinking>

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

Let's verify the content of the file to make sure it was saved correctly.
</thinking>

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                print("Hello, world!")
