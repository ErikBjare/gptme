User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
To solve this problem, we need to write a Python script that calculates and prints the 100th prime number. We can use a simple algorithm to check if a number is prime, and then use a loop to find the 100th prime number.
</thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Print the 100th prime number
print(nth_prime(100))
```

Now that we have written the script, we can run it using the python tool to get the 100th prime number.
</thinking>

```python
import prime
```

Please execute this code block to see the output. I will then provide the final answer.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
