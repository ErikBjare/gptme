```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

The script now asks for the user's name and creates a personalized greeting. Would you like me to show you the contents of the file to confirm the changes?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
