```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

The patch was successfully applied to `hello.py`. The file now asks the user for their name and prints a personalized greeting. If you'd like to verify the changes, I can use the `read` tool to display the updated contents of the file. 

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`


```stdout
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
