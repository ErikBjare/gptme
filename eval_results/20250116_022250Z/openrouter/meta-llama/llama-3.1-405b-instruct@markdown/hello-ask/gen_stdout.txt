Let me verify this by reading the file.

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`


```stdout
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
