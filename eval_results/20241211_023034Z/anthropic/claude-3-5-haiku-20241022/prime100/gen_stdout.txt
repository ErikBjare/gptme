User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number

```save prime.py

    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```

The 100th prime number is: 541
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The script successfully found the 100th prime number, which is 541. 

Let me break down how the script works:
1. `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
3. The script then prints the 100th prime number

The algorithm is simple and straightforward, using a brute-force approach to find prime numbers.

Would you like me to explain the code further or modify the script in any way?                                                                                [02:30:26] Tokens: 3138/124 in/out (session: 9098/342, turns: 3)
