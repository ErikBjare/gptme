```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py

1. Prompt the user to enter their name
2. Store the name in the `name` variable
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

Would you like me to do anything else with the script?                                                                                [02:30:19] Tokens: 2965/59 in/out (session: 5864/119, turns: 2)
