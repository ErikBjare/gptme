Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll patch the file to change the message.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                [02:31:07] Tokens: 2892/35 in/out

The file now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". Would you like me to do anything else with the file?                                                                                [02:31:09] Tokens: 2933/35 in/out (session: 5825/70, turns: 2)
