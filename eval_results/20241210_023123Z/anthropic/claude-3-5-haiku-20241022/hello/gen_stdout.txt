User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the `save` tool to create the `hello.py` script:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
                                                                                [02:31:07] Tokens: 2880/30 in/out

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Now, let's verify the contents of the file and then run it to make sure it works:

```shell
cat hello.py
```
                                                                                [02:31:08] Tokens: 2914/31 in/out (session: 5794/61, turns: 2)

print("Hello, world!")

System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Now, I'll run the Python script to demonstrate it works:

```python
with open('hello.py', 'r') as file:
    print(file.read())

print("\n--- Running the script ---")
%run hello.py
```                                                                                [02:31:10] Tokens: 2964/48 in/out (session: 8758/109, turns: 3)
