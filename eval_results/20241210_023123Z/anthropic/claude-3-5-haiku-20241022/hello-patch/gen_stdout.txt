Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
                                                                                [02:31:07] Tokens: 2892/39 in/out

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                [02:31:09] Tokens: 2937/28 in/out (session: 5829/67, turns: 2)

Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, human!")`

The code now prints "Hello, human!" instead of the original "Hello, world!" message. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this file?                                                                                [02:31:10] Tokens: 2984/44 in/out (session: 8813/111, turns: 3)
