User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```
                                                                                [02:31:10] Tokens: 2883/166 in/out

    if n < 2:                                                                   
        return False                                                            
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):                                         
        if n % i == 0:                                                          
            return False                                                        
    return True                                                                 
                                                                                
def find_nth_prime(n):                                                          
    count = 0                                                                   
    num = 2                                                                     
    while count < n:                                                            
        if is_prime(num):                                                       
            count += 1                                                          
        if count == n:                                                          
            return num                                                          
        num += 1                                                                
                                                                                
# Find and print the 100th prime number                                         
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)                                           
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")                          

System: Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Now, let's run the script to find the 100th prime number:

```python
with open('prime.py', 'r') as file:
    print(file.read())
```

```python
exec(open('prime.py').read())
```

The script does the following:
1. `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` finds the nth prime number by counting primes
3. Prints the 100th prime number

Would you like me to explain how the algorithm works or verify the result?                                                                                [02:31:13] Tokens: 3053/122 in/out (session: 5936/288, turns: 2)
