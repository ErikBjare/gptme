1. **Initialize a Git Repository:**
   We'll use the `git init` command to initialize a new git repository.

2. **Create `main.py`:**
   We'll create a `main.py` file with a simple Python script.

3. **Commit the File:**
   We'll add the file to the staging area and commit it with a message.

Let's execute these steps. I'll start by initializing the git repository.                                                                                [02:31:04] Tokens: 2882/113 in/out
