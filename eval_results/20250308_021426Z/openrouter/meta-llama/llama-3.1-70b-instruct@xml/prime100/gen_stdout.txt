User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's write a script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

First, we need to define a function to check if a number is prime. We can do this by checking if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

Next, we can use this function to find the 100th prime number. We can do this by iterating over all numbers and checking if they are prime. We can keep track of the number of prime numbers we've found so far, and stop when we've found the 100th one.

```python
def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1
```

Finally, we can use this function to print the 100th prime number.

```python
print(nth_prime(100))
```

Here's the complete script:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

print(nth_prime(100))
```

Let's run this script to find the 100th prime number.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
