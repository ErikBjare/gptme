User: 
Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll use the `patch` tool to modify the `hello.py` file:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

This patch will replace the original "Hello, world!" string with "Hello, human!" while keeping the rest of the file structure intact.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
