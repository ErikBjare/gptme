I'll use the patch tool to modify the file to ask for the user's name. The file content is simple, so I can easily create a patch that replaces the print statement with input and formatted output.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
