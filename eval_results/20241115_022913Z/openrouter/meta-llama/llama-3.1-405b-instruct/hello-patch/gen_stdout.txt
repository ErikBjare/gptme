Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py

```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

To modify the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", we can use the patch tool.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The patch has been successfully applied to `hello.py`. The file should now print "Hello, human!" when executed.

Let's verify this by reading the contents of the file:

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                
print("Hello, human!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The contents of `hello.py` have been successfully updated to print "Hello, human!". 

Let's execute the file to see the output:

```shell
python3 hello.py
```
