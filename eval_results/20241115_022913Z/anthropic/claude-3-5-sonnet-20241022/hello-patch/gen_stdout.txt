Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
I'll patch the file to change the message from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"
The change is simple - just modifying the string in the print statement.
</thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

-print("Hello, world!")                                                         
+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The patch has been successfully applied. The file now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". Would you like me to verify the change by reading the contents of the file?

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                
print("Hello, human!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Yes, I can confirm that the file now contains exactly what we wanted - a single line that prints "Hello, human!". Would you like to run the Python script to see it in action?

```shell
python3 hello.py
```                                                                                
Preview
python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, human!

System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, human!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! The script is working as intended, printing "Hello, human!" when executed. Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
