User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

1. Use `input()` to prompt the user for their name
2. Store the name in a variable
3. Use an f-string to create a personalized greeting

The script will now interactively ask for the user's name and then print a personalized "Hello, <name>!" message. Would you like me to demonstrate running the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
