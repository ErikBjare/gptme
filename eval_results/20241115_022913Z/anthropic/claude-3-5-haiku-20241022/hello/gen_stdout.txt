User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the `save` tool to create the hello.py script:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
                                                                                Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Now, let's verify the contents of the file using the `read` tool:

```shell
cat hello.py
```
                                                                                
print("Hello, world!")

System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Now, let's run the Python script to make sure it works:

```shell
python3 hello.py
```
                                                                                
Preview
python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, world!

System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, world!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! The script works exactly as intended. To break down what we did:
1. We used the `save` tool to create `hello.py`
2. We wrote a simple Python script that prints "Hello, world!"
3. We verified the file contents using `cat`
4. We executed the script using `python3`, which output the expected message

Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
