User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
<thinking> To write a script that computes and prints the 100th prime number, we need to create a function that checks if a number is prime and then use this function to find the 100th prime number. </thinking>

Here is a Python script that does this:
```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Print the 100th prime number
print(nth_prime(100))
```
Let's run this script to get the answer. 
```shell
python prime.py
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
