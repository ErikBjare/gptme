User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```
                                                                                [02:30:24] Tokens: 3112/181 in/out

```shell
python3 prime.py
```
                                                                                [02:30:25] Tokens: 3297/26 in/out (session: 6409/207, turns: 2)                 
           Cost:   $0.00          (session: $0.01)

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541

System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The script successfully computed the 100th prime number, which is 541. 

Let me break down how the script works:
1. `is_prime()` function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime()` function iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
3. The script specifically finds the 100th prime number and prints it
</thinking>

Would you like me to explain the algorithm further or modify the script in any way?                                                                                [02:30:29] Tokens: 3345/110 in/out (session: 9754/317, turns: 3)
