User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the `save` tool to create the `hello.py` script:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
                                                                                [02:30:20] Tokens: 3090/30 in/out

Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py

```shell
cat hello.py
```
                                                                                [02:30:22] Tokens: 3124/28 in/out (session: 6214/58, turns: 2)

print("Hello, world!")

System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Now, let's run the Python script to make sure it works:

```shell
python3 hello.py
```
                                                                                [02:30:24] Tokens: 3171/24 in/out (session: 9385/82, turns: 3)

Preview
python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, world!

System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, world!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! The script works as expected. 

To break down what we did:
1. We created a simple Python script `hello.py` using the `save` tool
2. We verified its contents using `cat`
3. We executed the script using `python3`, which printed "Hello, world!" to the console

Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this script?                                                                                [02:30:26] Tokens: 3211/81 in/out (session: 12596/163, turns: 4)
