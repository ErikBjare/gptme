User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
This is a simple task that requires creating a new Python file with a print statement.
I'll use the save tool to write the file directly.
</thinking>

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

Let's verify the script works by running it.

```shell
python3 hello.py
```                                                                                [02:30:21] Tokens: 3142/25 in/out (session: 6232/73, turns: 2)
