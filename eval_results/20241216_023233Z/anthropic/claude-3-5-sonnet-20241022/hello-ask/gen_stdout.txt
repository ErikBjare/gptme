```patch hello.py

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

1. Ask for the user's name using `input()`
2. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

Would you like me to do anything else with the file?                                                                                [02:31:29] Tokens: 2930/48 in/out (session: 5805/97, turns: 2)
