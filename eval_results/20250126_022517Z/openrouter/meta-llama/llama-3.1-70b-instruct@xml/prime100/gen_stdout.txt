User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking> To write a script that computes and prints the 100th prime number, we need to create a function that checks if a number is prime, then use this function to find the 100th prime number. </thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(nth_prime(100))
```

This script defines two functions: `is_prime` checks if a number is prime, and `nth_prime` finds the nth prime number. The `nth_prime` function uses the `is_prime` function to check each number until it finds the nth prime number. The script then prints the 100th prime number.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
