User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
                                                                                [02:30:34] Tokens: 3124/60 in/out

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! The patch has been applied to `hello.py`. Now the script will:
1. Prompt the user to enter their name
2. Store the name in a variable
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

Would you like me to show you the contents of the file to confirm the changes?

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                [02:30:37] Tokens: 3190/72 in/out (session: 6314/132, turns: 2)

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`


```stdout
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! The file has been successfully modified. The new script will:
- Ask the user "What is your name? "
- Use `input()` to capture the user's name
- Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

The changes look exactly as we intended. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this script?                                                                                [02:30:40] Tokens: 3298/69 in/out (session: 9612/201, turns: 3)
