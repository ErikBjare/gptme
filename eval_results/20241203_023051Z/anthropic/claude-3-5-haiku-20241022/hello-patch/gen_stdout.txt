Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
                                                                                [02:30:34] Tokens: 3127/39 in/out

```shell

The content is now `print("Hello, human!")`, which will print "Hello, human!" when the script is run. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this file?                                                                                [02:30:38] Tokens: 3219/50 in/out (session: 9518/117, turns: 3)
