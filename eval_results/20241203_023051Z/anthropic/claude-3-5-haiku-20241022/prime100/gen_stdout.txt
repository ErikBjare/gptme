User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```
                                                                                [02:30:37] Tokens: 3101/166 in/out

Let me verify the result by checking a few things:
1. The algorithm looks correct
2. The output seems reasonable
3. I'll double-check the 100th prime number using Python
</thinking>

```ipython
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

primes = [num for num in range(2, 1000) if is_prime(num)]
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {primes[99]}")
```
                                                                                [02:30:42] Tokens: 3315/142 in/out (session: 9687/330, turns: 3)

The verification confirms that 541 is indeed the 100th prime number. 
The script works correctly and efficiently.
</thinking>

The script successfully finds the 100th prime number, which is 541. A few key points about the implementation:
- `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
- The time complexity is O(n * sqrt(m)), where n is the nth prime and m is the value of that prime

Would you like me to explain any part of the script or demonstrate how it works?                                                                                [02:30:46] Tokens: 3478/137 in/out (session: 13165/467, turns: 4)
