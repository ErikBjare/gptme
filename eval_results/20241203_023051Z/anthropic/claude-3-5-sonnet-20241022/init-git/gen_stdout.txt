1. First, I'll initialize a git repository
2. Then create a simple main.py file
3. Finally, add and commit the file
</thinking>

```shell
git init
```

    print("Hello, World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

1. Initialized a git repository
2. Created a basic main.py file with a hello world program
3. Added and committed the file to git

The repository is now ready for further development. Would you like to make any changes or add more functionality?                                                                                [02:30:38] Tokens: 3358/62 in/out (session: 12914/178, turns: 4)
