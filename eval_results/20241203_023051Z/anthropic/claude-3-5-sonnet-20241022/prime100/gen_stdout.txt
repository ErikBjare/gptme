User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
Let me write a script to find the 100th prime number. I'll:
1. Write a function to check if a number is prime
2. Write a function to find the nth prime number
3. Use it to find the 100th prime number
</thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 100
    result = nth_prime(n)
    print(f"The {n}th prime number is: {result}")
```
                                                                                [02:30:35] Tokens: 3101/202 in/out

The 100th prime number is: 541

System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script has successfully computed that the 100th prime number is 541. 

Let's verify this is correct:
```ipython
# Verify our result by checking:
# 1. That 541 is indeed prime
# 2. That there are exactly 99 prime numbers before it
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Check 541 is prime
print(f"Is 541 prime? {is_prime(541)}")

# Count primes up to 541
primes_before = sum(1 for i in range(2, 541) if is_prime(i))
print(f"Number of primes before 541: {primes_before}")
```                                                                                [02:30:40] Tokens: 3348/182 in/out (session: 9756/403, turns: 3)

1. 541 is indeed a prime number
2. There are exactly 99 prime numbers before it

Therefore, 541 is definitively the 100th prime number.                                                                                [02:30:42] Tokens: 3557/48 in/out (session: 13313/451, turns: 4)
