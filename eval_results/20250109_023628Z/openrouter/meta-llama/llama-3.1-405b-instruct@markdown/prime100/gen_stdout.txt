User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
To find the 100th prime number, we need to generate prime numbers until we reach the 100th one. We can use a simple algorithm to check if a number is prime, and keep track of the count of prime numbers found so far.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
prime_number = nth_prime(100)
print(prime_number)
```

Now that we have the script, we can run it to find the 100th prime number.

```shell
python prime.py
