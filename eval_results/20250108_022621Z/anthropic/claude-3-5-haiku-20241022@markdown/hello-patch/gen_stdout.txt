Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the `patch` tool to modify the `hello.py` file:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

-print("Hello, world!")                                                         
+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! The patch was successfully applied. The `hello.py` file now contains the updated line `print("Hello, human!")`. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this file?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
