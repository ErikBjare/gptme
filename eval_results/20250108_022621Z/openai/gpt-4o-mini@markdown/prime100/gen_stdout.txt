User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
To compute the 100th prime number, we can use a simple algorithm that checks for prime numbers by testing divisibility. We'll start from the first prime number (2) and keep counting until we reach the 100th prime. 

Here's a step-by-step outline:
1. Initialize a counter for prime numbers.
2. Start checking numbers from 2 upwards.
3. For each number, check if it is prime by testing divisibility with all previously found primes.
4. If a number is prime, increment the counter.
5. Stop when the counter reaches 100 and print the prime number.

Now, I'll write the script in `prime.py`.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
