User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = nth_prime(100)
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {result}")
```

    if n < 2:

def nth_prime(n):                                                               
    count = 0

        num += 1

Let's run the script to see the result:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The script has successfully computed that the 100th prime number is 541. 

Let's verify this is correct:
1. First, 541 is indeed prime (it's only divisible by 1 and itself)
2. If we count prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, ... 541 is indeed the 100th one

The script works correctly! It uses:
- An efficient `is_prime()` function that checks divisibility up to the square root
- A `nth_prime()` function that counts up until it finds the nth prime number
- Clean output formatting

Would you like to make any modifications to the script or test it with different numbers?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
