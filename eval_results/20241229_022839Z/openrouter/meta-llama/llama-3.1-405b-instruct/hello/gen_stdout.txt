Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script hello.py has been created.

Let's verify the content of the script.

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                print("Hello, world!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script hello.py contains the expected code.

To run the script, we can use the python tool.

```python
import runpy
runpy.run_path('hello.py', run_name="__main__")
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
