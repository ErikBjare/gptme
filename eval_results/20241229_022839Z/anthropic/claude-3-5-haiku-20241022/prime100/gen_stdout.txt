User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```

    if n < 2:                                                                   
        return False                                                            
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):

def find_nth_prime(n):                                                          
    count = 0

# Find and print the 100th prime number                                         
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)                                           
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")                          

System: Saved to prime.py

```python
with open('prime.py', 'r') as file:
    print(file.read())
```

```ipython
exec(open('prime.py').read())
```

exec(open('prime.py').read())                                                   

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Executed code block.

```stdout
The 100th prime number is: 541
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The script successfully found the 100th prime number, which is 541. 

Let me break down how the script works:
1. `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
3. The script specifically finds the 100th prime number and prints it
</thinking>

Would you like me to explain the algorithm in more detail or modify the script in any way?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
