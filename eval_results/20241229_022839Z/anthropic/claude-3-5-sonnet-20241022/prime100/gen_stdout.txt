User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script worked correctly! It found that 541 is the 100th prime number. 

We can verify this is correct by checking against known mathematical references. The script:
1. Uses trial division up to square root for primality testing
2. Counts primes until it reaches the 100th one
3. Returns 541, which is indeed the 100th prime number

Would you like to make any modifications to the script or test it with different numbers?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
