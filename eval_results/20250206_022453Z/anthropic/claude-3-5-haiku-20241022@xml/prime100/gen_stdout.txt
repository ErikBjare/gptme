User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```

Now, I'll run the script to verify the result:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

Let me explain the approach:
1. `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
3. The script finds and prints the 100th prime number

The script is efficient and straightforward, using a simple primality test and counting method.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
