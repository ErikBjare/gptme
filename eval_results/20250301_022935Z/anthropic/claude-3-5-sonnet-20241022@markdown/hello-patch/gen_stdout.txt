Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll patch the file to change the message:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: âœ… Patch successfully applied to hello.py

The patch has been applied successfully. The file now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". Would you like me to do anything else with the file?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
