User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>
I'll create a function to:
1. Check if a number is prime
2. Generate prime numbers
3. Find the 100th prime number
</thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    primes = []
    num = 2
    while len(primes) < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            primes.append(num)
        num += 1
    return primes[-1]

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {find_nth_prime(100)}")
```

Now, I'll run the script to verify the result:

```shell
python prime.py
```

<thinking>
The script does the following:
- `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime()` generates prime numbers until it finds the nth prime
- Prints the 100th prime number
</thinking>

The script efficiently finds the 100th prime number by generating primes sequentially and stopping once it reaches the 100th prime. The time complexity is O(n * sqrt(p)), where n is the nth prime and p is the value of that prime.

Would you like me to explain the algorithm or make any modifications to the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
