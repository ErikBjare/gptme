The 100th prime number is: 541

Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The script successfully computed the 100th prime number, which is 541. 

Let me verify this result by breaking down the approach:
1. The `is_prime()` function checks primality by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number
2. The `find_nth_prime()` function iteratively finds prime numbers and counts them
3. When the count reaches 100, it returns that prime number

The result of 541 as the 100th prime number seems correct.

Would you like me to explain the algorithm or demonstrate how the script works in more detail?                                                                                [02:31:54] Tokens: 3266/124 in/out (session: 9504/343, turns: 3)
