Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the patch tool to modify the `hello.py` file:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
                                                                                [02:31:47] Tokens: 3013/41 in/out

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! The patch was successfully applied. The `hello.py` file now contains the updated greeting "Hello, human!" instead of the original "Hello, world!" message. 

Would you like me to verify the contents of the file or do anything else with it?                                                                                [02:31:49] Tokens: 3060/54 in/out (session: 6073/95, turns: 2)
