User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```hello.py

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
                                                                                [02:31:47] Tokens: 3027/60 in/out

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! The patch has been applied successfully. The script now does the following:
1. Prompts the user to enter their name using `input()`
2. Stores the name in the `name` variable
3. Prints a personalized greeting using an f-string

Would you like me to demonstrate running the script or explain any part of the modification?                                                                                [02:31:50] Tokens: 3093/71 in/out (session: 6120/131, turns: 2)
