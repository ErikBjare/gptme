Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")

print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                [02:31:46] Tokens: 3013/35 in/out
