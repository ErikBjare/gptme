User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the `save` tool to create the `hello.py` script:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
                                                                                [02:32:18] Tokens: 2873/30 in/out

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Now, let's verify the contents of the file and then run it to make sure it works:

```shell
cat hello.py
```
                                                                                [02:32:20] Tokens: 2907/31 in/out (session: 5780/61, turns: 2)

print("Hello, world!")

System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Now, I'll run the Python script to demonstrate it works:

```python
with open('hello.py', 'r') as file:
    print(file.read())

print("\n--- Running the script ---")
```

```shell
python3 hello.py
```                                                                                [02:32:22] Tokens: 2957/53 in/out (session: 8737/114, turns: 3)                 
           Cost:   $0.00          (session: $0.01)

python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, world!

System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, world!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! The script works exactly as intended. It prints "Hello, world!" when executed. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this script?                                                                                [02:32:24] Tokens: 3026/33 in/out (session: 11763/147, turns: 4)
