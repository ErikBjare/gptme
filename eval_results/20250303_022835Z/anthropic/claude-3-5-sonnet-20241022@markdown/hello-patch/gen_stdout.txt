Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll patch the file to change the message:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

-print("Hello, world!")                                                         
+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: âœ… Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The patch has been applied successfully. The file now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". Let me verify the change:

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                print("Hello, human!")System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
The file content confirms the patch was applied correctly. The code now prints "Hello, human!" as requested.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
