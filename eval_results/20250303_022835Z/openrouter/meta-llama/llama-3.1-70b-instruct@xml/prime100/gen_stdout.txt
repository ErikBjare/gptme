User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
Let's write a script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

First, we need to define a function to check if a number is prime. We can do this by checking if the number has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

Next, we need to find the 100th prime number. We can do this by iterating over numbers and checking if they are prime. We'll keep track of the count of prime numbers we've found so far.

```python
def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1
```

Finally, we can use this function to print the 100th prime number.

```python
print(nth_prime(100))
```

Let's put all of this together in a script called `prime.py`.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

print(nth_prime(100))
```

Now we can run this script to find the 100th prime number.

```shell
python prime.py
```

Let me know if you'd like to run this script.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
