1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file
2. The file contains a simple print statement that needs to be replaced with input and formatted output
3. I can use the patch tool since we have the original content and want to make a specific change
4. The change is small and well-defined
</thinking>           </thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
