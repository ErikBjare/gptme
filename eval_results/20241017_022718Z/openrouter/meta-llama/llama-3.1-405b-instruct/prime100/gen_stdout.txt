User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

To write a script that computes and prints the 100th prime number, we can create a Python script named `prime.py`. Here's how we can do it:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Compute and print the 100th prime number
prime_number = nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {prime_number}")
```                                                                                Saving to prime.py
System: Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Now that we have the script saved, let's run it using the Python interpreter to find and print the 100th prime number.

```shell
python prime.py
```                                                                                

Preview
$ python prime.py                                                               

The 100th prime number is: 541

System: 
Ran command: `python prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script successfully computed and printed the 100th prime number, which is indeed 541.
