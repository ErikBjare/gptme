User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number.

<thinking>
I'll use the following approach:
1. Create a function to check if a number is prime
2. Implement a method to find the 100th prime number
3. Print the result
</thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```

Now, I'll run the script to verify the result:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

<thinking>
The script does the following:
- `is_prime()` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
- `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it finds the nth prime
- We specifically find the 100th prime number and print it
</thinking>

The script efficiently finds the 100th prime number by:
1. Using an optimized primality test (checking divisors up to square root)
2. Incrementally counting prime numbers
3. Stopping when the 100th prime is found

Would you like me to explain the algorithm or verify the result?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
