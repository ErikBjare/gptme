The script hello.py has been created, but it seems that the ipython tool is unable to import it as a module. This is likely because the script is not in the Python path. To run the script, we can use the shell tool instead:

```shell
python3 hello.py
```                                                                                
Preview
python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, world!
System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, world!`
