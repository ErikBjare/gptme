User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name.

<thinking>
1. The file exists and contains a simple print statement
2. We need to:
   - Add input() to get the name
   - Modify the print statement to use the name
3. We can do this with a single patch
</thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
