User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the `save` tool to create the `hello.py` script:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Now I'll verify the contents of the file using the `read` tool:

```shell
cat hello.py
```
                                                                                print("Hello, world!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! Let's run the script to make sure it works:

```shell
python3 hello.py
```
                                                                                
Preview
python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, world!
System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, world!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script works exactly as expected! It prints "Hello, world!" when executed. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
