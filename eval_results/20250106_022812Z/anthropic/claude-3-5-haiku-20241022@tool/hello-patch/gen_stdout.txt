Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the `patch` tool to modify the `hello.py` file:
@patch(toolu_01YaWz9up14GzPCNa2qiQZRi): {"path": "hello.py", "patch": "<<<<<<< ORIGINAL\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n=======\nprint(\"Hello, human!\")\n>>>>>>> UPDATED"}

-print("Hello, world!")                                                         
+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

Now, let's verify the contents of the file:
@shell(toolu_01UD4RpG6jWuTiGAq2iM4D8F): {"command": "cat hello.py"}                                                                                print("Hello, human!")System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

The file has been successfully patched to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
