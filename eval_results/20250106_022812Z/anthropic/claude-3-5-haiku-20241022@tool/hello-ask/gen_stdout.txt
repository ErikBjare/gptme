User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

@patch(toolu_014HnyHbT5Lz3AkM9djfhuXy): {"path": "hello.py", "patch": "<<<<<<< ORIGINAL\nprint(\"Hello, world!\")\n=======\nname = input(\"What is your name? \")\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n>>>>>>> UPDATED"}

+name = input("What is your name? ")

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

I've modified the `hello.py` script to:
1. Ask the user for their name using `input()`
2. Store the name in a variable
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string
4. Preserve the original code's simplicity while adding interactivity

The patch replaces the original "Hello, world!" line with code that prompts for and uses the user's name.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
