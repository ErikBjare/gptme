Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

To modify the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!", we can use the patch tool. Here's the patch:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

-print("Hello, world!")                                                         
+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 

The patch was successfully applied to `hello.py`. The file should now print "Hello, human!" when executed. Let's verify this by running the file:

```shell
python hello.py
```                                                                                

Preview
python hello.py                                                                 

Hello, human!

System: 
Ran command: `python hello.py`

 `Hello, human!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The code in `hello.py` has been successfully modified to print "Hello, human!".
