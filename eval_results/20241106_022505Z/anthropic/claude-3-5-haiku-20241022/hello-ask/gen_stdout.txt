User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`


```stdout
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! The file has been successfully modified. Now the script will:
1. Prompt the user to enter their name using `input()`
2. Store the name in the `name` variable
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

Would you like me to demonstrate running the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
