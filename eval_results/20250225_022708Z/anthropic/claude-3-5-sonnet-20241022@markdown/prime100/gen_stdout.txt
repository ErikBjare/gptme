User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n = 100
    result = nth_prime(n)
    print(f"The {n}th prime number is: {result}")
```

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script has successfully computed that the 100th prime number is 541. 

We can verify this is correct by:
1. Confirming 541 is indeed prime (it is)
2. Counting that it's actually the 100th prime number

The sequence of first few prime numbers is: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ... , 541

The implementation uses an efficient approach:
- `is_prime()` checks divisibility only up to the square root of the number
- `nth_prime()` keeps a counter and checks numbers sequentially until it finds the nth prime

Would you like to modify the script in any way, such as finding a different nth prime or making it accept command line arguments?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
