User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(find_nth_prime(100))
```

Let's run the script to verify:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

<thinking>
I'll break down the solution:
1. `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` finds the nth prime number by:
   - Keeping track of how many primes have been found
   - Incrementing through numbers 
   - Returning the number when the nth prime is found
3. We call the function with 100 to find the 100th prime number
</thinking>

The script uses an efficient approach to find the 100th prime number by:
- Checking primality with a square root optimization
- Incrementally finding primes until the 100th is reached

Would you like me to explain the algorithm or verify the result?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
