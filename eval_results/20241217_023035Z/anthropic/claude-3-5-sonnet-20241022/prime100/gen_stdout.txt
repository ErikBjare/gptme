User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
print(nth_prime(100))
```
                                                                                [02:30:18] Tokens: 2852/137 in/out

# Find and print the 100th prime number                                         
print(nth_prime(100))                                                           

System: Saved to prime.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Let's run it to see the result:

```python
%run prime.py
```

System: Executed code block.
```output
541
```

The 100th prime number is 541. The script works efficiently by:
1. Using trial division up to square root for primality testing
2. Incrementally checking numbers until we find the nth prime

Would you like me to verify this result or make any modifications to the script?                                                                                [02:30:21] Tokens: 2993/92 in/out (session: 5845/229, turns: 2)
