User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number:

        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    candidate = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(candidate):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return candidate
        candidate += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```

```python
python prime.py
```

<thinking>
I'll explain the approach:
1. `is_prime()` function checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime()` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it finds the nth prime
3. The script will find and print the 100th prime number

Would you like me to explain the algorithm or verify the result?                                                                                [02:30:22] Tokens: 3037/105 in/out (session: 5889/286, turns: 2)
