User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number. Let's break this down:

<thinking>
1. We need a function to check if a number is prime
2. We need to count prime numbers until we find the 100th one
3. We'll use a simple but efficient approach:
   - Check divisibility up to square root of the number
   - Use early return for efficiency
</thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    
    # Check odd numbers up to square root
    for i in range(3, int(n ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
result = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {result}")
```

Let's run it to verify:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

The script will find the 100th prime number efficiently. The approach:
1. `is_prime()` checks primality by testing divisors up to square root
2. `find_nth_prime()` counts prime numbers until it reaches the nth one
3. We optimize by:
   - Skipping even numbers after 2
   - Only checking divisors up to square root
   - Only testing odd divisors

The script should output the correct 100th prime number, which is 541.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
