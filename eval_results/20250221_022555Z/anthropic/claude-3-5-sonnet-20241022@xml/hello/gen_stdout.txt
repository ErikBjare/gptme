User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the save tool to create hello.py:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

Let's verify the content:

```shell
cat hello.py
```

Now you can run it with:

```shell
python3 hello.py
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
