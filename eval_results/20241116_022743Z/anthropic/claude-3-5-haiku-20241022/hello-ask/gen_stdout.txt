```save hello.py
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

1. Use `input()` to prompt the user for their name
2. Store the name in a variable
3. Use an f-string to create a personalized greeting
4. Print the greeting with the user's name

The script will now interactively ask for the user's name before printing the greeting. Would you like me to demonstrate running the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
