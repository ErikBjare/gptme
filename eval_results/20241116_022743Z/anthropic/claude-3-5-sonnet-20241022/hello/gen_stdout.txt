User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
This is a simple task that requires creating a new Python file with a basic print statement.
I'll use the save tool to write the contents directly to hello.py.
</thinking>

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
                                                                                Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
Now that we've created the file, let's verify its contents and run it to make sure it works as expected.
</thinking>

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                


print("Hello, world!")

System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The file looks correct. Let's run it to verify it works as expected.
</thinking>

```shell
python3 hello.py
```                                                                                
Preview
python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, world!

System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, world!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! The script works as expected. It successfully:
1. Created the file hello.py
2. Contains the correct print statement
3. Runs and outputs "Hello, world!"
