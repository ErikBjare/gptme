User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a Python script to compute and print the 100th prime number:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    """Find the nth prime number."""
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```
                                                                                [02:30:33] Tokens: 3093/181 in/out

```shell
python3 prime.py
```
                                                                                [02:30:35] Tokens: 3278/26 in/out (session: 6371/207, turns: 2)                 
           Cost:   $0.00          (session: $0.01)

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541

System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Let me break down what the script does:

1. `is_prime(n)` function checks if a given number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` function finds the nth prime number by incrementally checking numbers and counting primes.
3. The script finds and prints the 100th prime number, which is 541.

Would you like me to explain the algorithm further or modify the script in any way?                                                                                [02:30:38] Tokens: 3326/98 in/out (session: 9697/305, turns: 3)
