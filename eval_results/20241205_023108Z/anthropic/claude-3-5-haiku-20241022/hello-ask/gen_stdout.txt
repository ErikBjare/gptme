1. Prompt the user to enter their name using `input()`
2. Use an f-string to create a personalized greeting
3. Print "Hello, <name>!" with the name provided by the user

Would you like me to show you the contents of the file to confirm the changes?                                                                                [02:30:34] Tokens: 3200/74 in/out (session: 6334/134, turns: 2)
