Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll patch the file to change the message.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                [02:30:30] Tokens: 3102/35 in/out

Would you like me to verify the change by reading the file?                                                                                [02:30:32] Tokens: 3143/37 in/out (session: 6245/72, turns: 2)
