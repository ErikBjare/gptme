Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
I'll use the patch tool to modify the existing code to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".
The change is simple - just replacing the text within the print statement.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")

The file hello.py now contains the updated message "Hello, human!". Would you like me to verify the contents of the file or help you with anything else?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
