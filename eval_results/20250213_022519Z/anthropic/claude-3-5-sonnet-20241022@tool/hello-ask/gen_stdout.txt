Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
1. I need to modify the existing hello.py file to add user input
2. I can use the patch tool since we have the original content and want to make a specific change
3. The change is simple - replace the print statement with input and formatted print
</thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
