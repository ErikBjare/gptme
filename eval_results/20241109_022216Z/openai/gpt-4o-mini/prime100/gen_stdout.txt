User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: To compute and print the 100th prime number, we can use a simple algorithm that checks for prime numbers by testing divisibility. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can implement this:

1. **Initialize a counter** to keep track of how many prime numbers we've found.
2. **Start checking numbers** from 2 (the first prime number).
3. For each number, check if it is prime by testing divisibility with all previously found primes.
4. If a number is prime, increment the counter.
5. Stop when the counter reaches 100 and print the prime number.

Now, let's write the script `prime.py`. 

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n, primes):
    for prime in primes:
        if prime * prime > n:  # No need to check beyond the square root of n
            break
        if n % prime == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_100th_prime():
    primes = []
    num = 2  # Start checking for primes from 2
    while len(primes) < 100:
        if is_prime(num, primes):
            primes.append(num)
        num += 1
    return primes[-1]  # Return the 100th prime

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(find_100th_prime())
```                                                                                Saving to prime.py
System: Saved to prime.py

You can run this script to compute and print the 100th prime number.
