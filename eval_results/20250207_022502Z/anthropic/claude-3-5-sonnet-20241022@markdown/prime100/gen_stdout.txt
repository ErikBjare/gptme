User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

The 100th prime number is: 541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script worked correctly! It found that the 100th prime number is 541. 

We can verify this is correct because:
1. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...
2. You can find lists of prime numbers online that confirm 541 is indeed the 100th prime number.

The script uses an efficient approach by:
- Only checking divisibility up to the square root of each number
- Using a simple counter to keep track of how many primes we've found
- Testing each number sequentially until we find the 100th prime

Would you like to modify the script in any way or test it with a different nth prime number?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
