I'll use the patch tool to modify the file to ask for the user's name and use string formatting to print the greeting.
The change is simple - we'll replace the static print with an input and formatted print.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What's your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
