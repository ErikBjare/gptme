User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Let's write a script to compute and print the 100th prime number. Here's a Python script that does that:
```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while True:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
        num += 1

print(nth_prime(100))
```
Let me explain what this script does:

1. The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime by iterating up to its square root and checking for divisibility.
2. The `nth_prime` function uses the `is_prime` function to find the nth prime number. It starts from 2 and increments the number until it finds the nth prime.
3. The script prints the 100th prime number by calling `nth_prime(100)`.

Let's run this script to get the answer!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
