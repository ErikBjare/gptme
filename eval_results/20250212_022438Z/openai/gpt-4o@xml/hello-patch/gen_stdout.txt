Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Certainly! Let's patch the code in `hello.py` to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". 

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")

print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
