I'll use the patch tool to modify hello.py to ask for the user's name and print a personalized greeting.
The patch will replace the simple print statement with input and formatted string.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
