```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

1. Ask for the user's name using `input()`
2. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

Would you like me to do anything else with the script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
