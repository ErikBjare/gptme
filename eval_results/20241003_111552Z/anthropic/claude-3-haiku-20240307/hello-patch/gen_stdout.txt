Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Okay, let's patch the `hello.py` file to print "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!".

<thinking>
To do this, I will use the `patch` tool to modify the file in a targeted way, rather than rewriting the entire file. This will allow me to make the specific change needed without affecting any other parts of the code.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

-print("Hello, world!")                                                         
+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great, the patch has been successfully applied to the `hello.py` file. The updated contents of the file are now:

```python
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let me know if you need anything else!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
