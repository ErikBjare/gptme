User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll use the `patch` tool to modify the `hello.py` file:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

This patch does the following:
- Replaces the original "Hello, world!" print statement
- Adds an `input()` function to prompt the user for their name
- Uses an f-string to print a personalized greeting with the user's name                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
