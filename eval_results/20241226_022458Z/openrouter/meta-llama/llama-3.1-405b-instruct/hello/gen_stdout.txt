print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script `hello.py` has been created and saved in the current directory.

To verify the contents of the script, we can use the `read` tool:

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                print("Hello, world!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script `hello.py` contains the expected code.

To run the script, we can use the `python` tool:

```python
import runpy
runpy.run_path('hello.py', run_name="__main__")
```                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
