Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll help patch the code to change the message.

<thinking>
1. The file contains a simple print statement
2. We need to modify the string from "Hello, world!" to "Hello, human!"
3. We can use the patch tool to make this change
</thinking>

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

-print("Hello, world!")                                                         
+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! The patch was successfully applied. The code in hello.py now prints "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". 

Would you like to verify the change by running the script or would you like to make any other modifications?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
