User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
This is a simple task that requires creating a new Python file with a print statement.
I'll use the save tool to write the file directly.

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

```shell

Hello, world!

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?                                                                                [02:30:29] Tokens: 3174/28 in/out (session: 9406/92, turns: 3)
