User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the `save` tool to create the `hello.py` script:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
                                                                                [02:30:31] Tokens: 3090/30 in/out

System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Now, let's verify the contents of the file using the `read` tool:

```shell
cat hello.py
```
                                                                                [02:30:33] Tokens: 3124/28 in/out (session: 6214/58, turns: 2)

print("Hello, world!")

System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Now, let's run the Python script to make sure it works:

```shell
python3 hello.py
```
                                                                                [02:30:34] Tokens: 3171/24 in/out (session: 9385/82, turns: 3)

Preview
python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, world!

System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, world!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! The script works as expected. 

To break down what we did:
1. We used the `save` tool to create `hello.py`
2. We verified the file contents using `cat`
3. We ran the script using `python3`, which printed "Hello, world!" to the console

Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this script?                                                                                [02:30:36] Tokens: 3211/78 in/out (session: 12596/160, turns: 4)
