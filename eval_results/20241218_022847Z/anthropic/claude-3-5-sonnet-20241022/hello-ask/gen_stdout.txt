User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

I'll use the patch tool to modify the file to add input for the user's name and update the print statement.
The change is small and localized, so a patch is more appropriate than rewriting the whole file.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```                                                                                [02:28:33] Tokens: 2875/87 in/out

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py

1. Ask for the user's name using input()
2. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

Would you like me to do anything else with the file?                                                                                [02:28:35] Tokens: 2968/46 in/out (session: 5843/133, turns: 2)
