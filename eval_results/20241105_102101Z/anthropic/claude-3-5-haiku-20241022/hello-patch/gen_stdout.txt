Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Let's verify the contents of the file to make sure the patch was applied correctly:

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                
print("Hello, human!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! The file has been successfully updated to print "Hello, human!" as requested. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this file or any other tasks you have in mind?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
