User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the `save` tool to create the `hello.py` script:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```                                                                                Saving to hello.py
System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Now, let's verify the contents of the file and then run it:

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                
print("Hello, world!")

System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Now, I'll run the Python script:

```shell
python3 hello.py
```                                                                                
Preview
python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, world!

System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, world!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! The script works exactly as intended. To break down what we did:
1. I used the `save` tool to create `hello.py`
2. We verified the contents using `cat`
3. We ran the script using `python3`, which printed "Hello, world!" to the console

Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
