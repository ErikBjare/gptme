User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
This is a simple task that requires creating a new Python file with a basic print statement.
I'll use the save tool to create hello.py.
</thinking>

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
Let's verify the content of the file to make sure it was saved correctly.
</thinking>

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                print("Hello, world!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script has been created successfully. You can run it with Python to see the output. Would you like me to show you how to run it?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
