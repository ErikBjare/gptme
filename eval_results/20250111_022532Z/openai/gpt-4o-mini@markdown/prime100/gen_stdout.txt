User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
To compute the 100th prime number, we can use a simple algorithm that checks for prime numbers by testing divisibility. We'll start from the first prime number (2) and keep counting until we reach the 100th prime. 

Here's a step-by-step outline:
1. Initialize a counter for prime numbers.
2. Start checking numbers from 2 upwards.
3. For each number, check if it is prime by testing divisibility with all previously found primes.
4. If a number is prime, increment the counter.
5. Stop when the counter reaches 100 and print the prime number.

Now, I'll write the script in `prime.py`.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n, primes):
    for prime in primes:
        if prime * prime > n:  # No need to check beyond the square root of n
            break
        if n % prime == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_100th_prime():
    primes = []
    num = 2  # Start checking for primes from 2
    while len(primes) < 100:
        if is_prime(num, primes):
            primes.append(num)
        num += 1
    return primes[-1]  # Return the 100th prime

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(find_100th_prime())
```
