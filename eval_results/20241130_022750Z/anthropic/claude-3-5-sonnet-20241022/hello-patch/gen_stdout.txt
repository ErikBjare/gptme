Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll help patch the code to change the message.

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The patch has been successfully applied. The file hello.py now contains the message "Hello, human!" instead of "Hello, world!". Would you like me to verify the contents of the file?

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                


print("Hello, human!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Yes, I can confirm that the file now contains exactly what we wanted: a single line printing "Hello, human!". Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
