User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(nth_prime(100))
```

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

python3 prime.py                                                                

541
System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script successfully found that the 100th prime number is 541. 

Would you like me to verify this result or make any modifications to the script? I can add features like:
1. Timing the calculation
2. Showing progress while calculating
3. Making it accept command line arguments for different n values

Just let me know if you'd like any changes!                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
