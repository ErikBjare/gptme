User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: 
I'll write a Python script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

# Find and print the 100th prime number
result = nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {result}")
```

Let's run it to verify:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

This script:
1. Defines an `is_prime()` function that efficiently checks if a number is prime
2. Defines an `nth_prime()` function that finds the nth prime number
3. Calls the function with n=100 and prints the result

The script will output the 100th prime number. The algorithm is reasonably efficient for this small case, using trial division up to the square root of each number being tested.                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
