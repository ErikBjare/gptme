+print("Hello, human!")

Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The patch has been successfully applied to `hello.py`. The file now contains the updated code:

```hello.py
print("Hello, human!")
```

Let's verify this by running the file:

```shell
python hello.py
```
