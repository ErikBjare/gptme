User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

1. Adding an `input()` function to ask for the user's name
2. Using an f-string to personalize the greeting with the user's name

Would you like me to show you the contents of the file to confirm the changes?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
