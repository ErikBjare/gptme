User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the `save` tool to create the `hello.py` script:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Now let's verify the contents of the file and run it:

```shell
cat hello.py
```
                                                                                print("Hello, world!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Now, let's run the Python script:

```shell
python3 hello.py
```                                                                                
Preview
python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, world!
System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, world!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script works perfectly! It prints "Hello, world!" as expected. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this script or would you like to create another Python program?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
