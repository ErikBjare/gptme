User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: To compute and print the 100th prime number, we can use a simple algorithm that checks for prime numbers. Here's how we can implement this in a script named `prime.py`:

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(nth_prime(100))
```
                                                                                [02:32:17] Tokens: 3004/159 in/out                                              
           Cost:   $0.00

    if n <= 1:
