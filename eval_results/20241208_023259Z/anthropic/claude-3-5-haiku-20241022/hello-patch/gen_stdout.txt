Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the patch tool to modify the `hello.py` file:

```patch hello.py

print("Hello, world!")

print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```
                                                                                [02:32:22] Tokens: 3013/41 in/out
