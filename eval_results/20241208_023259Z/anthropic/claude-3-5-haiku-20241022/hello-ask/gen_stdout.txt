```patch hello.py

name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")

1. Use `input()` to prompt the user for their name
2. Store the name in a variable
3. Use an f-string to create a personalized greeting

The script will now interactively ask for the user's name and then print a personalized "Hello, <name>!" message.

Would you like me to show you the contents of the file to confirm the changes?                                                                                [02:32:25] Tokens: 3111/91 in/out (session: 6156/151, turns: 2)
