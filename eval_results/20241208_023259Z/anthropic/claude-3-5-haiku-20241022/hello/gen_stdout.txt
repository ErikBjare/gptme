User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the `save` tool to create the `hello.py` script:

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
                                                                                [02:32:21] Tokens: 3001/30 in/out

print("Hello, world!")                                                          

System: Saved to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Now, let's verify the contents of the file using the `shell` tool to read it:

```shell
cat hello.py
```
                                                                                [02:32:24] Tokens: 3035/31 in/out (session: 6036/61, turns: 2)

print("Hello, world!")

System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, world!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Now, let's run the Python script to make sure it works correctly:

```shell
python3 hello.py
```
                                                                                [02:32:25] Tokens: 3085/25 in/out (session: 9121/86, turns: 3)                  
           Cost:   $0.00          (session: $0.01)                              

Preview
python3 hello.py                                                                

Hello, world!

System: 
Ran command: `python3 hello.py`

 `Hello, world!`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! The script works exactly as expected. To recap:
1. We created `hello.py` with a simple print statement
2. We verified the file contents using `cat`
3. We ran the script with `python3`, which printed "Hello, world!"

Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this script?                                                                                [02:32:27] Tokens: 3126/69 in/out (session: 12247/155, turns: 4)
