User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number

```save prime.py

    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 2
    while count < n:
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
        if count == n:
            return num
        num += 1

# Find and print the 100th prime number
hundredth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
print(f"The 100th prime number is: {hundredth_prime}")
```

The 100th prime number is: 541

System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The script worked correctly. Let me break down what the code does:
1. `is_prime(n)` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to its square root
2. `find_nth_prime(n)` iterates through numbers, counting primes until it reaches the nth prime
3. We specifically requested the 100th prime number, which the script found to be 541
</thinking>

The 100th prime number is 541. The algorithm efficiently finds this by:
- Checking each number for primality 
- Keeping a count of how many primes have been found
- Stopping when the 100th prime is reached

Would you like me to explain the algorithm in more detail or modify the script in any way?                                                                                [02:32:29] Tokens: 3223/154 in/out (session: 9401/347, turns: 3)
