User: write a script hello.py which prints "Hello, world!"
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
This is a simple task that requires creating a new Python file with a basic print statement.
I'll use the save tool to create hello.py.
</thinking>

```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
                                                                                [02:32:22] Tokens: 3001/48 in/out

```shell
python3 hello.py

Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?                                                                                [02:32:26] Tokens: 3088/28 in/out (session: 9142/95, turns: 3)
