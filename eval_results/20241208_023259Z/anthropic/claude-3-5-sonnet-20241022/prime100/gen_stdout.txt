User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```

The 100th prime number is: 541

System: 
Ran command: `python3 prime.py`

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script has successfully computed that the 100th prime number is 541. 

Let's verify this is correct:
1. First, 541 is indeed prime (it's only divisible by 1 and itself)
2. If we count prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, ... 541 is indeed the 100th one

The script works correctly and efficiently by:
- Using trial division up to square root for primality testing
- Incrementally checking numbers until we find the nth prime
- Using straightforward and readable code structure

Would you like to make any modifications to the script or test it with different values?                                                                                [02:32:34] Tokens: 3194/166 in/out (session: 9351/330, turns: 3)
