User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll write a script to find the 100th prime number.

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```

Let's test it:

```shell
python3 prime.py
```

The script uses an efficient implementation:
1. `is_prime()` checks primality by testing divisors only up to square root
2. `nth_prime()` counts up until it finds the nth prime number
3. When run, it will compute and print the 100th prime number                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
