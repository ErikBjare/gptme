Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! Let me verify the contents of the file to confirm the change:

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                


print("Hello, human!")
System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
The patch was successfully applied, and the file now contains the updated print statement "Hello, human!" as requested.
</thinking>

Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this file or any other tasks you have in mind?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
