```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! The patch has been applied to `hello.py`. The script will now:
1. Prompt the user to enter their name
2. Store the name in the `name` variable
3. Print a personalized greeting using an f-string

Would you like me to do anything else with the script?                                                                                [02:25:57] Tokens: 2941/62 in/out (session: 5816/122, turns: 2)
