User: 
modify hello.py to ask the user for their name and print 'Hello, <name>!'. don't
try to execute it

```hello.py

```

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! The patch was successfully applied to hello.py. The script now does the following:
1. Prompts the user to enter their name using `input()`
2. Uses an f-string to create a personalized greeting that includes the user's name

Would you like me to show you the contents of the file to confirm the changes?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
