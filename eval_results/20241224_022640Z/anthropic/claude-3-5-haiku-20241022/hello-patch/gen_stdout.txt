Patch the code in hello.py to print "Hello, human!"

```hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: I'll use the patch tool to modify the hello.py file:

```patch hello.py
<<<<<<< ORIGINAL
print("Hello, world!")
=======
print("Hello, human!")
>>>>>>> UPDATED
```

+print("Hello, human!")                                                         

System: Patch successfully applied to hello.py
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Great! The patch was successfully applied. Would you like me to verify the contents of the file or do anything else with it?

```shell
cat hello.py
```                                                                                print("Hello, human!")System: 
Ran allowlisted command: `cat hello.py`

 `print("Hello, human!")`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Perfect! The file has been updated as expected. The content is now `print("Hello, human!")`, which matches our patch. Is there anything else you'd like me to do with this file or script?                                                                                --- Finished generation ---
