User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: To compute and print the 100th prime number, we can use a simple algorithm that checks for prime numbers. Here's how we can structure the script:

1. Define a function to check if a number is prime.
2. Use a loop to find prime numbers until we reach the 100th one.
3. Print the 100th prime number.

Let's write the script in `prime.py`. 

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def find_nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    nth_prime = find_nth_prime(100)
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime}")
```
                                                                                [02:29:23] Tokens: 3093/222 in/out                                              
           Cost:   $0.00
