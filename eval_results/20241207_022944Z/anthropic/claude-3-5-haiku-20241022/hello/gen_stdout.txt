```save hello.py
print("Hello, world!")
```
                                                                                [02:29:27] Tokens: 3090/30 in/out

```shell
cat hello.py
```
                                                                                [02:29:28] Tokens: 3124/28 in/out (session: 6214/58, turns: 2)

```shell
python3 hello.py
