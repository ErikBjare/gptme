User: write a script prime.py that computes and prints the 100th prime number
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: <thinking>
Let me write a Python script to find the 100th prime number. I'll:
1. Write a function to check if a number is prime
2. Write a function to find the nth prime number
3. Use it to find the 100th prime number
</thinking>

```save prime.py
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def nth_prime(n):
    count = 0
    num = 1
    while count < n:
        num += 1
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return num

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(f"The 100th prime number is: {nth_prime(100)}")
```
                                                                                [02:29:28] Tokens: 3093/193 in/out

 `The 100th prime number is: 541`
Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: The script successfully found that the 100th prime number is 541. 

Would you like me to:
1. Verify this result is correct?
2. Optimize the code to make it faster?
3. Add any additional features to the script?                                                                                [02:29:32] Tokens: 3330/51 in/out (session: 9713/262, turns: 3)
