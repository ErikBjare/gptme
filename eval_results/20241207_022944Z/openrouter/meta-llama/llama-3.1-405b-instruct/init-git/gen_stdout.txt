Assistant: Thinking...                                                                                Assistant: Let's initialize a git repository, write a main.py file, and commit it.

First, we need to initialize a git repository. We can do this by running the following command:
```shell
git init
```
                                                                                [02:29:35] Tokens: 3092/45 in/out

```save main.py
print("Hello, World!")
```
                                                                                [02:29:37] Tokens: 3201/34 in/out (session: 6293/79, turns: 2)

```shell
git add main.py
```                                                                                [02:29:40] Tokens: 3239/34 in/out (session: 9532/113, turns: 3)

```shell
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```                                                                                [02:29:42] Tokens: 3286/31 in/out (session: 12818/144, turns: 4)
