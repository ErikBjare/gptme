gptme documentation
===================

Welcome to the documentation for ``gptme``!

``gptme`` is a tiny command-line application that allows you to interact with AI agent equipped with powerful local tools, acting as a copilot for your computer, via the terminal. It can execute python and bash, edit local files, search and browse the web.

To get an understanding about how it works, the easiest way is to try it out yourself by following the :ref:`Getting Started` guide. If you want to see some examples of what you can do with it, check out the :ref:`Demos` and :ref:`Tools`.

It is designed to be easy to use and extend, and can be used as a library or a standalone application. It also has a tiny :ref:`Web UI` with basic functionality.

See the `README <https://github.com/ErikBjare/gptme/blob/master/README.md>`_ file for more general information about the project.
