Getting Started
===============

This guide will assist you in beginning your journey with gptme.

Installation
------------

To install gptme, we recommend using pipx:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipx install gptme

If pipx is not installed, you can install it using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --user pipx

Usage
-----

To initiate a new chat or select an existing one, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme

This will show you a list of past chats, allowing you to select one or start a new one.

Writing a file
**************

You can then interact with the assistant. Lets start by asking it to write code.

.. chat::

   User: create a new file named life.py implementing the game of life

   Assistant: Certainly! I'll create a new file named `life.py` implementing Conway's Game of Life. This implementation will use NumPy for efficient array operations and Matplotlib for visualization. Here's the code:
   ```life.py
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
   ...
   ```

   System: Saved to life.py

The assistant will prompt for your confirmation and save the file, as requested.

Making changes
**************

We can also start chats and request changes directly from the command line. The contents of any mentioned text files will be included as context, and the assistant will generate patches to apply the requested changes:

.. code-block:: bash

   gptme 'make improvements to life.py so that dead cells fade out over time'

.. chat::

   User: make improvements to life.py so that dead cells fade out over time
   ```life.py
   ...
   ```

   Assistant: To make alive cells green and dead cells black in the Game of Life simulation, we need to modify the colormap and how we represent the cell states. Here's the updated `life.py` script with these changes:
   ```patch life.py
   ...
   ```

   System: Patch applied

.. note::
    With the browser extras installed, the assistant can also process URLs included in the prompt.

Other tools
***********

You can read about other tools on the :doc:`tools` page.

Other interfaces
****************

There are other ways to interact with the assistant:

Command line
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Commands can also be executed directly from the command line. For example, one can skip confirmation prompts and  run in non-interactive mode to terminate when all prompts have been completed:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme --non-interactive --no-confirm 'create a snake game using curses in snake.py, dont run it' '-' 'make the snake green and the apple red'

This should make it first write snake.py, then make the change in a following prompt. The '-' is special "multiprompt" syntax that tells the assistant to wait for the next prompt before continuing.

Web UI
^^^^^^

To run the assistant in a web interface, execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme-server

This should let you view your chats in a web browser and make basic requests.

.. note::
    The web interface is still in development and is not fully functional (no confirmation prompts or streaming).
