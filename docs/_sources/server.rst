Server
======

.. note::
   The server and web UI is still in development and does not have all the features of the CLI.
   It does not support streaming, doesn't ask for confirmation before executing, lacks the ability to interrupt responses and tool calls, etc.

gptme has a minimal REST API with very minimalistic web UI.

It can be started by running the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme-server

For more CLI usage, see :ref:`the CLI documentation <cli:gptme-server>`.

There are a few different interfaces available:

Web UI
------

A basic chat interface with minimal dependencies that is bundled with the server.

Simply start the server to access the interface at http://localhost:5000

Fancy Web UI
------------

A modern, feature-rich web interface for gptme is available as a separate project `gptme-webui <https://github.com/ErikBjare/gptme-webui>`_. It is being built with `gptengineer.app <https://gptengineer.app>`_.

You can access it directly at `gptme.gptengineer.run <https://gptme.gptengineer.run>`_.

To serve gptme-webui locally, see the `README <https://github.com/ErikBjare/gptme-webui>`_.

Features:

- Modern React-based interface with shadcn/ui
- Streaming of responses
- Mobile-friendly design
- Dark mode support
- Offline/exports support
