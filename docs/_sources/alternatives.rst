Alternatives
============

The AI-assisted development space is rapidly evolving, with many projects emerging and rapidly improving. Here, we'll provide an overview of gptme and some similar projects that might be good alternatives (or vice versa) for your use case, highlighting their key features to help you understand the landscape.

When selecting an AI-assisted development tool, consider the following factors:

1. Your preferred working environment (terminal, IDE, etc.)
2. The specific tasks you need assistance with
3. Integration with your existing workflow
4. The level of control and customization you require

Each of these projects has its own strengths and may be better suited for different use cases. We encourage you to explore them and find the one that best fits your needs.

If your answers to these questions are "terminal", "general-purpose/coding", "extensible", and "highly customizable", gptme might be the right choice for you.

Remember that the AI-assisted development space is rapidly evolving, and these tools are continuously improving and adding new features. Always check the latest documentation and releases for the most up-to-date information.

Let's start with the comparison, we will first show an overview comparison and then dig deeper into each alternative.

Comparison
----------

While we obviously like gptme, there are other great projects in the AI-assisted development space that provide similar but different capabilities, which be more what you are looking for.

Here we will briefly introduce some we like, along with their key features.

Projects
--------

To begin, lets first introduce gptme and then we will compare it to some of the other projects in the space.

gptme
^^^^^

gptme is a personal AI assistant that runs in your terminal, designed to assist with various programming tasks and knowledge work.

Key features:

- Runs in the terminal
- Can execute shell commands and Python code
- Ability to read, write, and patch files
- Web browsing capabilities
- Vision support for images and screenshots
- Self-correcting behavior
- Support for multiple LLM providers

First commit: March 24, 2023.

Aider
^^^^^

Aider is AI pair programming in your terminal.

Key features:

- Git integration
- Code editing capabilities
- Conversation history
- Customizable prompts
- Scores highly on SWE-Bench

Differences to gptme:

- gptme is less git-commit focused
- gptme is more general-purpose?
- gptme has wider array of tools?

First commit: April 4, 2023.

Moatless Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Moatless Tools <https://github.com/aorwall/moatless-tools>`_ is an impressive AI coding agent that has performed really well on `SWE-Bench <https://www.swebench.com/>`_.

Key features:

- Various specialized tools for different tasks
- Integration with popular development environments
- Focus on specific development workflows
- Scores highly on SWE-Bench

OpenHands
^^^^^^^^^

`OpenHands <https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands>`_ (formerly OpenDevin) is a leading open-source platform for software development agents, with impressive performance on benchmarks and a large community.

Key features:

- Leading performance on SWE-bench (>50% score)
- Can do anything a human developer can: write code, run commands, browse web
- Support for multiple LLM providers
- Both CLI and web interface
- Docker-based sandboxed execution
- Active development and large community (46.9k stars)

Differences to gptme:

- More focused on software development
- Has web UI in addition to CLI
- Larger community and more active development
- Docker-based sandboxing vs gptme's direct execution

First commit: March 13, 2024.

Lovable.dev
^^^^^^^^^^^

`lovable.dev <https://lovable.dev>`_ (previously `GPT Engineer.app <https://gptengineer.app>`_) lets you build webapps fast using natural language.

Key features:

- Builds frontends with ease, just by prompting
- LLM-powered no-code editor for frontends
- Git/GitHub integration, ability to import projects
- Supabase integration for backend support

Differences to gptme:

- gptme is terminal-only (for now)
- gptme is much more general-purpose
- gptme is far from low/no-code
- gptme is far from as good at building frontends
- gptme is not no-code, you still need to select your context yourself

Disclaimer: gptme author Erik was an early hire at Lovable.

Cursor
^^^^^^

If you are a VSCode user who doesn't mind using a fork, this seems to be it.

Differences to gptme:

- gptme is in-terminal instead of in-vscode-fork
- gptme is extensible with tools, more general-purpose
  - Less true now that Cursor supports MCP

Claude
^^^^^^

Anthropic's Claude has gotten popular due to its excellent coding capabilities. It has also championed MCP as a way to extend its capabilities and solve the n-to-m problem of tool clients (Claude Desktop, Cursor) and servers (browser, shell, python).

.. https://docs.anthropic.com/en/release-notes/claude-apps

.. rubric:: Projects

Claude Projects lets users upload their files and chat with them. It requires a Claude subscription.

Released Jun 25, 2024.

.. rubric:: Artifacts

Claude Artifacts allows users to directly preview certain content, like HTML and React components, allowing to build small web apps with Claude.

It is like a mini-version of Lovable.dev.

Released Aug 27, 2024.

.. rubric:: Desktop

Claude Desktop is a desktop client for Claude.

It supports MCP, allowing for a wide array of tools and resources to be used with it. (gptme also intends to support MCP)

Released October 31st, 2024.

ChatGPT
^^^^^^^

.. rubric:: Code Interpreter

ChatGPT's Code Interpreter was one of the early inspirations for gptme as an open-source and local-first alternative, giving the LLM access to your terminal and local files.

There's not much to compare here anymore, as gptme has evolved a lot since then (while Code Interpreter hasn't), but it's worth mentioning as it was one of the first projects in this space.

Released July 6, 2023.

.. rubric:: Canvas

ChatGPT Canvas was OpenAI's response to Claude Artifacts (released ~1 month before).

Released October 3, 2024.
