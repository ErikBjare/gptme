## python

When you send a message containing Python code to python, it will be executed in a stateful Jupyter notebook environment. Python will respond with the output of the execution or time out after 120.0 seconds. The drive at '/mnt/data' can be used to save and persist user files. Internet access for this session is disabled. Do not make external web requests or API calls as they will fail.

# Tools

## python

When you send a message containing Python code (and is not a file block), it will be executed in a stateful environment.
Python will respond with the output of the execution.

The following libraries are available:
{python_libraries_str}

## bash

When you send a message containing bash code, it will be executed in a stateful bash shell.
The shell will respond with the output of the execution.

These programs are available, among others:
{shell_programs_str}

## saving files

To save a file, output a code block with a filename on the first line, like "```src/example.py" (a "file block").
It is very important that such blocks begin with a filename, otherwise the code will be executed instead of saved.

## bash

```bash
git ls-files
```
> stdout: `README.md`
```bash
cat README.md

## Python

> User: print hello world
```python
print("Hello world")
```

## Save files

> User: write a Hello world script to hello.py
```hello.py
print("Hello world")
```
Saved to `hello.py`.

## Read files

Reading is done using `cat`.

> User: read hello.py
```bash
cat hello.py
```
(prints the contents of `hello.py`)

## Putting it together

> User: run hello.py
```bash
python hello.py

> stdout: `Hello world!`
