To patch/modify files, we can use an adapted version of git conflict markers.

This can be used to make changes to files, without having to rewrite the whole file.
Only one patch block can be written per codeblock. Extra ORIGINAL/UPDATED blocks will be ignored.
Try to keep the patch as small as possible. Avoid placeholders, as they may make the patch fail.

To keep the patch small, try to scope the patch to imports/function/class.
If the patch is large, consider using the save tool to rewrite the whole file.
